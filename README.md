## Overview

Sets up a Simple Server for Chocolatey packages. Allows you to [host your own packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/How-To-Host-Feed), many times as a private package repository (feed).

## Module Description

There are three types of package feeds for Chocolatey - local folder/CIFS (UNC) share, simple server, and the sophisticated package gallery. Simple server is in the middle and most widely used Chocolatey/NuGet Package Server format.

**Advantages:**
* Push over HTTP/HTTPS.
* API key for pushing packages.
* No direct access to packages - acls are locked down to just admins and push through api key.
* Package store is file system.

**Disadvantages:**
* Only one API key, so no multi user scenarios.
* Starts to affect choco performance once the source has over 500 packages (maybe?).
* No moderation.
* No website to view packages.
* No package statistics.

For more details about the other types of package feeds, see [host your own feed](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/How-To-Host-Feed).

## Setup

### What Chocolatey Server affects

* Will create files at c:\tools\chocolatey.server.
* Will install IIS and ASP.NET if not already installed.
* Will remove the default website.
* Sets up a website on port 80 (configurable) pointing to chocolatey.server

### Setup Requirements

* Chocolatey installed
* [`chocolatey/chocolatey`](https://forge.puppet.com/chocolatey/chocolatey) OR [`puppetlabs/chocolatey`](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/chocolatey)
  * **Note:** either or both of these modules can handle ensuring the install of Chocolatey.

### Beginning with Chocolatey Server

Install this module via any of these approaches:

* [puppet forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/chocolatey/chocolatey_server)
* git-submodule ([tutorial](http://goo.gl/e9aXh))
* [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet)
* [r10k](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k)

## Usage

Ensure the server is installed and configured:

~~~puppet
include chocolatey_server
~~~

### Use a different port

~~~puppet
class {'chocolatey_server':
  port => '8080',
}
~~~

### Use an internal source for installing the `chocolatey.server` package

~~~puppet
class {'chocolatey_server':
  server_package_source => 'http://someinternal/nuget/odatafeed',
}
~~~

### Use a local file location for the `chocolatey.server` package

~~~puppet
class {'chocolatey_server':
  server_package_source => 'c:/folder/containing/packages',
}
~~~
